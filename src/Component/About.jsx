                        I just completed my graduation in B. Sc in CSE from Brac University. In addition, I also completed several courses
                        related to Web application development. Those courses were offered by The University of Michigan and Duke
                        University through Coursera. However, I am confident in my ability to contribute to the success of your team
                        because of my sound understanding of MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js.
